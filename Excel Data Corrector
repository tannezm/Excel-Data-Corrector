## Version 1
## Purpose of program is to correct user typos in data in large excel files
## Program takes user input for what column needs corrected and what data needs corrected
## Program then uses the rapidfuzz library to find the closest match to the user input
## Program then asks the user if the match is correct
## If the match is correct, the program will replace the data in the excel file with the corrected data
## If the match is incorrect, the program will ask the user to input the correct data
## Program will then replace the data in the excel file with the corrected data
## Program will then ask the user if they would like to correct more data
## If the user says yes, the program will repeat the process

# Program works best with data that is not too similar to other data in the column

# WARNING: This program is not perfect and may not work for all data types. Additionally, some strings may be too similar for the program to differentiate 
# between them and may inadvertantly change data that does not need to be corrected. Program will save the corrected data in a new excel file called "corrected_excel_file.xlsx"
