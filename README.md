This program is designed to correct user typos in string data in large excel files where it is not practical to manually find and change the data.

Program works best with data that is not too similar to other data in a column.

WARNING: This program is not perfect and may not work for all data types. Additionally, some strings may be too similar for the program to differentiate 
between and may inadvertantly change data that does not need to be corrected. Verify that no other data could be changed. Program will save the corrected data
in a new excel file called "corrected_excel_file.xlsx"
